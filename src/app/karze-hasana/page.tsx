							<ul className="ml-4 list-disc">
								<li className='my-1'>Bangladesh is a country of mosques. Some villages have up to five or six mosques. To facilitate the division of the lending areas into very small units mosque based, so that the borrowers can access services very easily.</li>
								<li className='my-1'>As the lending area is very small  the management team and the borrowers get to know each other very closely and overall management becomes easier for the management team. It would be almost impossible to get the members of the branch management team together except on Fridays.</li>
								<li className='my-1'>Almost all the Muslims in an area attend the mosque at a certain time on Fridays. If loans are disbursed openly in the presence of local residents after Juma  there is much less chance of corruption or irregularities.</li>
